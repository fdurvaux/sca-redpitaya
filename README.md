# SCA-Pitaya

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how state-of-the-art side-channel attacks exploiting power leakages can be conducted on platforms representative of IoT devices.

## Repository organisation

The repo is organised with the following folders
1. _analysis_ holds the scripts necessary to perform the side-channel analyses and attacks.
2. _docs_ holds the extra documentation for helping in the design of the probe/pre-amplifier front-end.
3. _lib_ contains the libraries necessary for interfacing with the Red Pitaya platform as well as functions used in the side-channel analyses.
4. _targets_ holds the demonstration code adapted for the Arduino Uno and Arduino Due platforms.
5. _traces_ is the folder where all the traces and intermediate data are stored.
